  (** {2:registration Protocol registration.} *)

  (** A flow is a system that allows entities to transmit {i payloads}. These
      entities do not have to care about the underlying transport mechanism.
      flows simply deal with routing and delivering of these payloads. That
      abstraction allows these protocols to compose.

      For example, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is representable as a
      flow, because it is able to encapsulate some {i payloads} without
      interpreting it. A counter-example is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
      (SMTP) which needs an interpretation of its {i payloads}: tokens such as
      [EHLO] or [QUIT] have a direct incidence over the life-cycle of the
      connection.

      An other protocol representable as a flow is the Transport Layer Security
      (TLS), as it deals only with privacy and data integrity. [Conduit] is able
      to compose flows together like [TCP âˆ˜ TLS] to make a new flow.
      Higher-level protocols can be built in top of these abstract flows: for
      instance, Secure Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SSMTP) or HyperText
      Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) can be defined on top of both TCP and
      TLS. Using [Conduit], these can be abstracted to work over any flow
      implementations. *)

  (** The type for client protocols. ['edn] is the type for endpoint parameters.
      ['flow] is the type for underlying flows.

      Endpoints allow users to create flows by either connecting directly to a
      remote server or by resolving domain names (with {!connect}). *)

  val register : ('edn, 'flow) impl -> ('edn, 'flow) protocol
  (** [register i] is the protocol using the implementation [i]. [protocol] must
      provide a [connect] function to allow client flows to be created.

      For instance, on Unix, [Conduit] clients will use [Unix.sockaddr] as flow
      endpoints, while [Unix.file_descr] would be used for the flow transport.

      {[
        module TCP :

        end = struct
          let t = register (module TCP)
        end
      ]}

      Client endpoints can of course be more complex, for instance to hold TLS
      credentials, and [Conduit] allows all these kinds of flow to be used
      transparently:

      {[
        module TLS :

        end
      ]}

      expose the {i witness} of it. Then, users will be able to use it. *)

  (** [equal p0 p1] can proves that 2 protocols share same types. *)

  (** {2 Injection and Extraction.}

      The goal of [Conduit] is to provide:

      - A way to manipulate a fully-abstract [flow].
      - A way to manipulate a concrete and well-know [flow].

      [Conduit] provides several mechanisms to be able to manipulate our
      abstract type {!flow} and destruct it to a concrete value such as a
      [Unix.file_descr]. [Conduit] can assert one assumption: from a given
      abstracted [flow], it exists one and only one {!FLOW} implementation.

      As [Conduit] determines this implementation, the user can determine the
      used implementation when he wants to {!send} or {!recv} datas.

      So [Conduit] uses or extracts uniqely the implementation registered before
      with {!register} and no layer can tweak or update this assertion.

      {!repr}, {!flow}, {!impl} and {!is} can extracts in differents ways the
      abstracted {!flow}:

      - with the {i pattern-matching}
      - with {i first-class module}
      - with the function {!is} *)
